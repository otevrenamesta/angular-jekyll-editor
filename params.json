{"name":"Angular-jekyll-editor","tagline":"Angular based editor for jekyll based sites","body":"# Angular based editor for jekyll based sites\r\n\r\nThis is an angular based editor for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) based sites.\r\nIts intended for use with sites hosted on github pages.\r\nGithub pages are awsome project but so less people can handle git and/or jekyll details.\r\nThey just want to be able to perform few basic operations without any technical knowledge.\r\nThis is goal of the angular-jekyll-editor.\r\n\r\n## usage\r\n\r\nAfter login process (use your github credentials, that has access to target repo) you get to dashboard.\r\nIt shows history of changes + some little info paragraps.\r\nUse menu to navigate to desired manipulation views.\r\n\r\nAngular-jekyll-editor lets you handle 3 basic things:\r\n\r\n- pages: on page view you can see tree structure of pages along with handling buttons.\r\nOn right side there is preview (uses iframe, so what you see is live version).\r\nBy clicking on a page tree item you change url of the iframe so you see the appropriate page.\r\n, add/edit pages and posts. TBD\r\n- posts: posts are very similar to pages except they are not structured in tree.\r\nThey instead follow category/tag based structure.\r\nThat's why it is necessary to fill then when creating new posts.\r\n- media files: And to upload/delete media files.\r\nJust filebrowsing button and list of uploaded files (with delete button).\r\nWhat to say more about? :)\r\n\r\n## Installation and configuration\r\n\r\nFor details see [README.md](https://github.com/otevrenamesta/angular-jekyll-editor/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nHope someone finds the angular-jekyll-editor handy.\r\n\r\nCheers!","google":"UA-59651506-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
